true-insomniac
==============
A script that indicates to the subscribed user the number of unread thread messages specifically for the forum of  www.insomnia.gr. I originally created it in order to have the indicator in my tmux status line.

All you have to do is to change the username and password in the python script with yours.

Dependencies (Linux)
------------
  * Selenium:  `sudo pip install selenium`
  * PhantomJS: `sudo apt-get install phantomjs` (for Debian based)

Execution
---------
    ➜  ~ ./true_insomniac.py
